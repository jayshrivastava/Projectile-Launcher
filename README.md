# Projectile-Launcher

My final grade 12 physics project involved making a marble shooter.  
Instead of making a crossbow, trebuchet, or spring-loaded launcher, I made a contraption similar to a football shooter using two motors, an Arduino, and two lego tires. 

This is the bit of code I used to run it.
